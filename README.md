# Didelphis Sound Change Applier

Samantha F McCabe, 2019

The Didelphis SCA is a powerful, script-driven sound-change applier program implemented in Java. It supports UTF-8 natively and has a rule syntax designed for clarity and similarity to sound change notation in linguistics.

The Didelphis SCA supports capabilities like:
 * multiple rule conditions
 * regular expressions
 * metathesis
 * unrestricted variable naming
 * scripting (importing or executing other rule sets)
 * phonetic features

but also allows novice users to ignore advanced functionality they do not need.
